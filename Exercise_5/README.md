Take a picture using the Camera

This is a small example of how to use camera package to use the device's camera.


We use a future builder because opening of camera by camera preview is async task.
We also learned the implementation of try and catch through error handling.
I also learned how to create screens on the fly with flutter's MaterialPageRoute.
